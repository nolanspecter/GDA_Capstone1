# Case Study Roadmap - Process

## Guiding Questions

1. What tools are you choosing and why?

I choose to use Spreadsheet and Python. Spreadsheet is convenient in checking the integrity of the data and Python is used for handling big dataset such as when all the data is combined together

2. Have you ensured your data integrity? 

Yes, the data is consistent throughout the columns.

3. What steps have you taken to ensure that your data is clean?

First the duplicated values where removed, then the columns where formatted to achieve consistency. I also removed invalid entries (ones with negative ride time)

4. How can you verify that your data is clean and ready to analyze?

I can verified it by Spreadsheet built-in function

5. Have you documented your cleaning process so you can review and share those results?

Yes, it's all documented in the 'Data Manipulation Documentation'.
