- Yes I did. The data points out some differences between the two types

2. What story does your data tell?

- By looking at the figures, we can see that the number of members who uses the bike is higher but the mean ride length is lower, this might indicates that the the members usually used the bike on scheduled commute such as going to work or going for groceries, while the casual users tend to use it more like a hobby and a leisure activvity.

3. How do your findings relate to your original question?

- The findings build a profile for members and casual riders, pointing out the keys differences between casuals and annual riders, also knowing whey they use the bikes helps to find "How digital media could influence them".
